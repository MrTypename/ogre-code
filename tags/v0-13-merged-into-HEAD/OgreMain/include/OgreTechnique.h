            material the pass may be split into multiple passes if the graphics card cannot
            handle the number of texture units requested. For passes with fragment programs, however, 
            the number of passes you create will never be altered, so you have to make sure

            level of detail. Increasing LOD indexes are lower levels of detail. You can 
            assign more than one Technique to the same LOD index, meaning that the best 
            Technique that is supported at that LOD index is used.
